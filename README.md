1. I have attached an .ipynb file for the preview of code and its output.
2. tqdm is supposed to stop mid-way since we are only picking ten news.
3. I used nltk for sentiment analysis, so please kindly use nltk.download to download required resources (commented out in code)
4. The whole process of the code includes scraping (using beautifulsoup, preprocessing done when scraping) saved in .json files, and sentiment analysis (using nltk).
5. The code (sentiment.py) will take approximately under 10 seconds to run, no input needed.
6. Please refer to requirements.txt for package installations.
7. Please refer to in-code comments for line-to-line documentations.
